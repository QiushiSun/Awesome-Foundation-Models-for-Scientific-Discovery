## 2. Introduction

Foundation Models such as GPT-4, AlphaFold, and FunSearch are reshaping the landscape of scientific discovery. Historically, scientific progress has been structured around four core paradigms: experimental, theoretical, computational, and data-driven. Foundation models introduce a new trajectory that potentially constitutes a fifth paradigm, characterized by partially or fully autonomous scientific reasoning systems.

These models unify capabilities across language, code, and multimodal inputs. They support hypothesis generation, automate experimentation, guide methodological decisions, and produce structured outputs. Through these capabilities, they are not merely speeding up research, but are redefining how science is conducted and conceptualized.

## 3. Core Philosophy

### Philosophy

- **Human**: Responsible for framing problems, making final decisions, and maintaining scientific integrity.
- **Foundation Models**: Serve as assistants or collaborators that enhance searching, reasoning, modeling, and writing.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Ensures that human agency, ethical accountability, and critical judgment remain central.

### Objectives

- Increase the efficiency of research workflows such as literature review, experiment design, and scientific writing.
- Improve research quality by supporting structured reasoning and cross-domain knowledge integration.
- Lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to engage in high-quality scientific inquiry.
- Preserve human control and oversight to avoid risks associated with full automation.

## 4. FM-Assisted Scientific Discovery Examples

### 4.1. Topic Exploration

Foundation models assist researchers in identifying emerging topics, knowledge gaps, and interdisciplinary intersections by querying large-scale corpora and structured databases.

**Example**: 

Human: What are the underexplored challenges in protein design in academic research?

AI: [Underexplored Challenges in Protein Design by OpenAI Deep Research](./topic_exploration_example.md)

**Recommended Tools**:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Elicit](https://elicit.com/)
- [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)

### 4.2. Literature Survey

FMs summarize academic literature, cluster publications into themes, and highlight influential papers or trends.

**Example**: 

Human: Please help me conduct a literature survey on protein design.

AI: [Survey about protein design by OpenAI Deep Research](./literature_survey_example.md)

**Recommended Tools**:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Elicit](https://elicit.com/)
- [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)


### 4.3. Problem Refinement

FMs enable iterative refinement of research questions based on novelty, feasibility, or scope, offering domain-specific insights and suggestions.

**Example**: 

Human: I intend to design a foundation model-based agent for protein design. Please analyze and refine the research problem.

**Recommended Tools**:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)

### 4.4. Methodology Design

FMs provide assistance in designing or modifying research methodologies, including experiment protocols, model selection, and variable control strategies.

**Example**: 

Human: Please help me design a deep learning model for analyzing gene expression data, taking into account as many factors as possible.

AI: [Methodology Design by OpenAI Deep Research](./methodology_design_example.md)

**Recommended Tools**:
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)

### 4.5. Experimentation

FMs generate executable code, simulate experimental conditions, or interact with laboratory robots, enabling rapid testing and iteration.

**Example**:

Human: Please generate the corresponding program according to this method: [Method](./methodology_design_example.md).

AI: [Code generated by ChatGPT](./experimentation_example.md)

**Recommended Tools**:
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [AutoGluon](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon)

### 4.6. Paper Writing and Polishing

FMs assist with outlining, drafting, rewriting, and proofreading scientific papers. They also help generate visuals or translate content between formats.

**Example**: An LLM transforms a collection of experimental logs and plots into a structured LaTeX paper draft, including title suggestions, abstract summaries, and formatted references.

## 6. Summary

This paper proposes a shift from the traditional human-led research process to a future of human-AI collaboration and, eventually, autonomous scientific inquiry. Foundation models are not only improving scientific efficiency but also introducing new epistemic agents capable of participating in, and potentially leading, the generation of scientific knowledge. This transformation calls for a rethinking of research workflows, authorship, accountability, and the future of science itself.
